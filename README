1. Create new GitHub project: "create-records-db"
2. Create two different pages to allow the end user create new
objets/records. At least one form, should include a relationship with another
table. (e.g): The forms we created in class (enrollment --> student).
3. Once the record has been created, the form data shouldn't lost. Not white
screens as response are allowed, same fashion as we did with the "calculator"
exercise in clase. The same initial form should be displayed.
4. Attach the following screenshots:
	4.1. Web application
	4.2. Creating records
	4.3. Database before and afterwards
